# A Basic Shell written in Rust

This is a very simple shell that I've written using Rust. It supports the `cd` command, `exit`, pipes, and any terminal programs you would normally think to execute.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the git repository.
2. Verify Rust is installed.
2. Run the shell using `cargo run`.
